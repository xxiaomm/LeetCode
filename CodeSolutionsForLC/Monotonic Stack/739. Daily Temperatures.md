#### Code

```java
// 找第一个比它小的, 单调递增栈
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] t) {
        int n = t.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && t[stack.peek()] < t[i])
                res[stack.peek()] = i - stack.pop();
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity

Time complexity: O(N); 
However, each element can only be added to the stack once, which means the stack is limited to N pops. Every iteration of the while loop uses 1 pop, which means the while loop will not iterate more than N times in total, across all iterations of the for loop.

An easier way to think about this is that in the worst case, every element will be pushed and popped once. This gives a time complexity of O(2⋅N)=O(N).

Space complexity: O(N);    
If the input was non-increasing, then no element would ever be popped from the stack, and the stack would grow to a size of N elements at the end.

Note: answer does not count towards the space complexity because space used for the output format does not count.
