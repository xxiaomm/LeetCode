### Idea_1

1. DFS


#### Code

```java

class Solution {
    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // 构造邻接链表
        List<Integer>[] adj = new LinkedList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            adj[i] = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
            adj[edges[i][0]].add(edges[i][1]);
            adj[edges[i][1]].add(edges[i][0]);
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < adj.length; i++) {
            if (!visited.contains(i)) {
                dfs(i, adj, visited);
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    public void dfs(int cur, List<Integer>[] adj, Set<Integer> visited) {
        if (visited.contains(cur))
            return;
        visited.add(cur);
        for (int i = 0; i < adj[cur].size(); i++)
            dfs(adj[cur].get(i), adj, visited);
    }
}


```

#### Complexity

E = Number of edges, V = Number of vertices.    

Time complexity: O(E+V).    
Building the adjacency list will take O(E) operations, as we iterate over the list of edges once, and insert each edge into two lists.

During the DFS traversal, each vertex will only be visited once. This is because we mark each vertex as visited as soon as we see it, and then we only visit vertices that are not marked as visited. In addition, when we iterate over the edge list of each vertex, we look at each edge once. This has a total cost of O(E+V).    

Space complexity: O(E+V).   
Building the adjacency list will take O(E) space. To keep track of visited vertices, an array of size O(V) is required. Also, the run-time stack for DFS will use O(V) space.
