### Clarifications / Constraints

1. head != null
2. intersection not exist ?
3. one list is the sublist of another one?

### Idea_1

1. Use two pointer pA, pB start with two list headA, headB seperately;
2. Set pointer pA to point at headA, set pointer pB to point at headB;
3. While pA != pB, move to the next node;
4. If pA == null, pA = headB, if pB == null, pB = headA;
5. Then both of pA and pB move the same distance: lenA + lenB - the public;

#### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode pA = headA, pB = headB;
        while (pA != pB) {
            pA = pA == null ? headB : pA.next;
            pB = pB == null ? headA : pB.next;
        }
        return pA;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity

Time complexity: O(n+m), n and m are the length of lsit1 and list2.  
Space complexity: O(1)
