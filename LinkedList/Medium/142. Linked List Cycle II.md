### Clarifications / Constraints

1. no cycle;
2. length of list: null ?

### Idea

1. Use two pointer(slow-fast) to detect the cycle;
2. If has the cycle, slow-fast will intersect at the cycle, at this time, set fast at  head, and change the step size to two;
3. Then slow-fast will intersect at the position of the starting point of the cycle.


#### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null)  return null;
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast)
                break;
        }
        if (slow != fast) return null;
        fast = head;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity

Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
