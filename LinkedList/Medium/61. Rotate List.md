### Idea

 
 1. Close the list into the ring.
 2. Traverse the list and get the length of it.
 3. Find the previous node of the last k % length node from the end of the list. 
 4. Break the ring at the position: after the new tail or before the new head.
 

#### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1,head), curr = dummy;
        int len = 0;
        while (curr.next != null) {
            len++;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        curr.next = head;   // close the list into the ring
        curr = dummy;
        for (int i = 0; i < len-k%len; i++) 
            curr = curr.next;
        head = curr.next;
        curr.next = null;
        return head;
    }
}
```


#### Complexity

Time complexity: O(n), n is the length of the list.  
Space complexity: O(1).
