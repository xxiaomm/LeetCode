I am a second-year graduate student majoring in Computer Science at New York University. I'm experienced with Java. In the past, I had a full-stack internship at Neusoft Corporation during my undergraduate period. And I also have some projects experiences including front-end, back-end, mobile development and operating system. Some frameworks that I used are SpringBoot, React, Node.js and Express. I am familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Besides, I'm experienced with relational databases such as MySQL and non-relational databases such as MongoDB. 

对公司和其技术栈的了解:

> 参考：对公司技术栈的了解: I know that the official website of Roblox is using the popular Front-end framework AngularJS, which is also used in one of my Full Stack project. In addition, my friend who is having an internship at Roblox told me that the backend of Roblox is mainly implemented by .Net. So I’m excited to learn more about your company and the chance to contribute to your web development team with my skills.


Now I love ***Open Source*** very much. Since I got the essence of it, I organized my GitHub. I share my codes of some projects on GitHub to get feedback from other developers in order to improve my code quality and hope to inspire others. Besides, I also shared my learning notes such as notes of learning new frameworks and notes of new phrases that I learned of English. I enjoy in sharing and learn a lot from this way.


I have some hobbies. My favorite is dancing. I also like some challenging sports, such as skiing, skydiving, paragliding, bungee jumping. It's not because I'm so brave. Of course, I am scared, but I still try to do them. Because they are very exciting and you could get different feelings and views form them.
