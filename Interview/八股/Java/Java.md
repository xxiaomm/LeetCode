# Basic concepts

<font color="#1D94FD"> 1. What is JAVA? </font>   
Java is a high-level programming language and is ***platform-independent***. 

<font color="#1D94FD"> 2. What are the features of JAVA? </font>    

- OOP concepts
  - Object-oriented
  - Inheritance  [ɪnˈherɪtəns] 
  - Encapsulation 封装 [ɪnˌkæpsjuˈleɪʃ(ə)n]
  - Polymorphism 多态 [ˌpɑˌliˈmɔrfɪzm] 
  - Abstraction 
- Platform independent: A single program works on different platforms without any modification. （JVM）
- High Performance: JIT (Just In Time compiler) enables high performance in Java. JIT converts the ***bytecode*** （计算机可以直接执行而不是经过某平台再翻译给计算机）into machine language and then JVM starts the execution. (JIT:因为解释执行必然比执行编译好的机器指令的执行效率低，所以引入JIT（即时编译器）。在执行时，JIT会把翻译过的机器码保存起来，已备下次使用，因此从理论上来说，采用JIT技术能够在执行效率上，接近曾经纯编译技术。https://blog.csdn.net/Genmer/article/details/119355224)
- Multi-threaded: A flow of execution is known as a Thread. JVM creates a thread which is called the main thread. The user can create multiple threads by extending the thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.

<font color="#1D94FD"> 3. How does Java enable high performance? </font>       
Java uses Just In Time compiler to enable high performance. It is used to convert the instructions into bytecodes.

<font color="#1D94FD"> 4. Name the Java IDE’s? </font>    
Eclipse and NetBeans are the IDE’s of JAVA.

<font color="#1D94FD"> 5. What do you mean by Constructor? </font>    
***Constructor can be explained in detail with enlisted points:***

- When a new object is ***created*** in a program a constructor ***gets invoked*** corresponding to the class.
- The constructor is a method which has ***the same name*** as the class name.
If a user doesn’t create a constructor implicitly a ***default*** constructor will be created.
The constructor can be overloaded. 重载
If the user created a constructor with a parameter then he should create another constructor ***explicitly*** without a parameter.  

<font color="#1D94FD"> 6. What is meant by the Local variable and the Instance variable? </font>     

***Local variables:*** are defined in the method and scope of the variables that exist inside the method itself.    
***Instance variables:***is defined inside the class and outside the method and the scope of the variables exists throughout the class.


<font color="#1D94FD"> 7. What is the class? </font>     

All Java codes are definded in a Class. It has variables and methods.   
Variables are attributes which define the state of a class.    
Methods are the place where the exact business logic has to be done. It contains a set of statements or instructions to satisfy the particular requirement.


<font color="#1D94FD"> 8. What is an Object? </font>     

 An instance of a class is called an object. The object has state and behavior.     
Whenever the JVM reads the “new()” keyword then it will create an instance of that class.
